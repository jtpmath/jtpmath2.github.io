# The Problems with Measures 

## Introduction

So we're trying to abstract the notion of "mass" to shapes whose geometry isn't easily understood. 

We start by definining a notion of distance. Okay, that's a topology. 

Because if you can define distance between points, if points are sufficiently far apart, then you can talk about space. 

Space necessitates that things are not the same. Things, objects, collections. Sets. Functions. I'm getting ahead of myself. 

If you can talk about space bewteen points (distance) then, you can talk about things between spaces between points. 

But between you and me, something amazing happened... 

Now we're all taking up space.

We aim to abstract the notion of “mass” to include shapes whose geometry isn’t immediately intuitive.

To begin, we define a concept of distance—this gives us a topology.

Once we can define distance between points, we can talk about space. If points are sufficiently far apart, space emerges.

Space implies that things are distinct. Objects, collections—sets. And with sets, we have functions. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

If we can discuss the space between points (distance), then we can explore the things between those spaces, and the relationships within them.

But here’s where something incredible happens…

Now, we're all occupying space.


## Tonelli's Theorems, Limits and Colimits

~~Tonelli's theorem says that the morphism mu commutes with colimits (cartesian product of measure spaces).~~
